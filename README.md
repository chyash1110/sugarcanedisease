# Sugar Cane Disease Detection

This project aims to detect diseases in sugar cane crops using deep learning techniques. The system is designed to classify images of sugar cane leaves into different disease categories. The model is trained on a dataset of sugar cane leaf images, utilizing convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for image classification.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project consists of sugar cane leaf images, categorized into healthy and diseased classes. The images are preprocessed and augmented to enhance model performance.

## Model Architecture

The deep learning model employs a convolutional neural network with multiple layers for feature extraction and classification. The architecture includes convolutional layers, max-pooling layers, and dense layers. The model is trained to recognize patterns associated with various sugar cane diseases.

## Training

The model is trained using the TensorFlow framework. The training process involves multiple epochs, and the dataset is split into training, validation, and test sets. The model's performance is monitored through accuracy and loss metrics during training.

## Results

The trained model is evaluated on a test set to assess its generalization to new, unseen data. The results include accuracy and loss values, providing insights into the model's effectiveness in disease detection.

## Prediction

The system allows users to make predictions on sample sugar cane leaf images. The model predicts the disease class along with a confidence score. Users can visualize the actual and predicted classes, enabling an understanding of the model's performance on specific instances.

## How to Use

1. **Dataset**: Ensure you have a dataset of sugar cane leaf images with appropriate disease labels.
2. **Configuration**: Adjust constants such as `IMAGE_SIZE`, `BATCH_SIZE`, `EPOCHS`, and others according to your dataset and computational resources.
3. **Training**: Run the training script to train the model on your dataset.
4. **Prediction**: Utilize the trained model for making predictions on new sugar cane leaf images.

Feel free to explore and customize the code for your specific use case. This project serves as a foundation for building robust disease detection systems in agriculture.
